## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Style
We favor PEP8 style. However we are not so strict about it since the goal of this platform
is to provide a rapid prototyping framework for communication-based AI research.
With that in mind, we do appreciate good coding practices, but they are not necessarily
a must.
